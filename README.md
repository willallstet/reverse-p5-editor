# Welcome to reverse p5 editor!
This is a p5.js[https://p5js.org/] prototype I made that switches the canvas and code editor, translating what you draw into code! Yet again, I was interested in adding a new avenue to exploring code for novices. With this tool, the user can see the graphic changes directly, plainly reflected in the corresponding code! Try it out here[https://willallstet.github.io/reverse-p5-editor/].
